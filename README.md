# Image_Compresion_and_Reconstruction
By using Fast Fourier transforms, Convert time domain into frequency domain which computer can analyze easily and obtain an image which has lower frequency and gradually goes to higher frequency, with the help of this frequency patterns a computer can construct the original image. This is done with the help of inverse Fast Fourier transforms.
